<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The University of New Brunswick Archives' extensive collection of class
composites and group photographs, covering the period 1873-1975, are a
significant resource for university staff and alumni, external researchers, and
genealogists. But these valuable photos have been under-used and largely
inaccessible for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most are mounted in ornate wooden frames, and are under glass, making them very heavy.  This, coupled with the fact that many are oversized (the largest measuring approximately 5 ft x 7 ft) made retrieval cumbersome.</li>
  <li>Proper photo storage racks were not available which resulted in the photos being stored, by size, in any available nook and cranny within the secure stack area, making retrieval a "guessing game."</li>
  <li>Access to the photos was limited to a generic entry in the photo card index under "Class Photographs", followed by the year of the photo.  It was, therefore, impossible to find an individual's picture using only their name.</li>
  <li>Provision of high-quality hard copy images of individual graduates involved complex arrangements with Media Services' staff photographers.</li>
  <li>In some cases, the only available image of a student particularly in the 19th century, may only be found on the class composite photograph (publication of UNB yearbooks was not regularised until the 1940s; a smattering of photos began appearing in the <cite>University Monthly / Brunswickan</cite>, the student newspaper, only in the early 1900s).</li>
</ul>

<p>These factors, along with the availability of expertise and technology in
the UNB Libraries Digital Imaging Centre, made the Archives' composite photo
collection a perfect candidate for a web-based digitisation project. The
advantages were obvious: enhanced access, the availability of high quality
images, and the option of ordering images on-line.  In February 2005, Archives'
staff embarked on an imaging/indexing project in collaboration with staff from
the Digital Imaging Centre and Library Systems.</p>

<p>Three years on, the end result is a powerful database allowing researchers
quick and convenient access to hundreds of digital images, covering over a
century of student life at UNB.</p>
